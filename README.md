# Declarative DeepProblog

## Setup:
This problem relies on `deepproblog-dev` (available from `https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/deepproblog-dev`), which provides a complete setup guide.

Further we need to implement the predicates for cosine similarity, mse, distributional cosine similarity, and rbf. To do so add the implementation to the engine and add them.
