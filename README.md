# Declarative DeepProblog

Declarative DeepProblog is a declarative extension to DeepProblog, DeepStochlog and all neuro-symbolic languages that rely on neural predicates. 

## Setup:
This problem relies on `deepproblog-dev` (available from `https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/deepproblog-dev`), which provides a complete setup guide.

Further we need to implement the predicates for cosine similarity, mse, distributional cosine similarity, and rbf. To do so add the implementation to the engine and add them.
